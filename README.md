# Bookmarker
I have build an application for storing website urls using JavaScript, CSS and HTML. We will use Local Storage to store the bookmarks and can delete it too. This is a simple CRUD operations application made for understanding the working of local storage and power of javascript. In this application I have also made simple validation for url's which validate that the url is valid or not.
